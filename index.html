        A community oriented agriculture project with a vision, Here and There Grain Project is many things‚Äîa peri-urban farm, a seed cleaning facility, and a mill for locally grown staple crops (primarily grains) on the North Shore of Massachusetts.

      <p class="short-summary">
        Founded in 2021 by a bread baker interested in working more closely with soil and plants, Here and There Grain Project aims to address the high barrier of entry for local vegetable farmers incorporating grain production into their crop rotations through technical assistance and collaborative cultivation.

        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>
          A community oriented agriculture project with a vision, Here and There Grain Project is many things‚Äîa peri-urban farm, a seed cleaning facility, and a mill for locally grown staple crops (primarily grains) on the North Shore of Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As farmers and millers, we pour our attention into each rotation. In doing so, we produce nutrient-dense whole foods with every successful harvest, but this project is about more than creating another ingredient for a local diet; it‚Äôs about giving back. It is about learning from the land and the plants that we have co-evolved with, practicing our role in this reciprocal relationship‚Äîgiving our fields rest and giving thanks‚Äîa role that is practiced not at all by industrial farms and whenever possible by local farms, limited though they are by the seemingly ever-increasing pressure to increase production to stay out from under the boot of pitiless industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, we grow food! Here and there we grow food.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our crops are sustainably grown. All of our collaborating farmers follow organic practices and constantly seek new ways to facilitate soil and ecosystem health. Eliminating the introduction of toxins through zero use of pesticides is one of the ways that we protect the health of our communities and soils for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our tools are old (as old as a 1938 Allis Chalmers All Crop combine), but we are patient mechanics, investing our time in machines that will make lighter work for our busy hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we reflect on commodity pricing! Whirlwind pricing representative of global balance sheets, without an ounce of respect for the livelihoods of the folks and lands growing our food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here and there our grasses will grow. Wherever a good crop can be grown, wherever a cover crop is needed, challenging the common uses for land with our proximity to an economic center, Boston, and the heft of money that influences our communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we mill flour on stone mills, slowly grinding grain at a cool temperature, preserving the natural oils and mineral content of the grain and resulting in a more nutrient-dense and flavorful flour. Roller-milled flour (most flour in consumer products and sold in supermarkets in the United States) has been stripped of these nutrients in the milling process, resulting in a nutrient-dead product, devoid of the fiber necessary to properly digest. At the 2017 Whole Grain Summit in Vienna, researchers asserted that  ‚Äúreplacing refined grains with whole grains globally could reduce the burden of chronic disease more than any other change.‚Äù[2] We also just simply believe that it tastes better. Fresh-milled stone-ground flour maintains the delicious, complex flavors of regional grain varieties.
        </p>
        <p>
          A project in pursuit of symbiosis, Here and There because HERE üëà and üëâ THERE !! Because it‚Äôs all we can do. Because the grains grown HERE share a history with the grains grown THERE. Everywhere the grass courageously raises its seeds to the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a way to further diversify a crop rotation, winter grain production enables farmers to carefully rest their fields without entirely foregoing a marketable food offering. Fallowing fields is an essential tool for the sustainable grower and winter grains provide an opportunity to see a field through the colder months, their roots anchoring a soil‚Äôs biological ecosystem, continuing to photosynthesize in the shoulder seasons and creating proverbial trade routes for the microbial and fungal nutrient exchange. In the early spring, these hearty grasses with their firm hold on life can be grazed to promote tillering, giving our ruminant friends an opportunity to deposit some organic fertility on our fields. We often seed a nitrogen-fixing legume like clover near the final frost date, our winter grains act as a nursery for the clover and when the grain is harvested off as a mid-summer cash crop, the clover is ready to take off and nourish, aerate and protect the soil through another winter, readying the field to return to vegetable production the following summer.

      <h2>About the Farmer/Owner/Operator</h2>
      <p>
        Andrew‚Äôs background is trending towards jack-of-all-trades these days, but his childhood spent working in restaurants and in his dad‚Äôs woodworking shop have had a lasting effect, evidenced by his resumed focus on food systems and farm equipment design and repair. After receiving a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UMass Amherst, Andrew spent four years in Burlington, VT working in restaurants until he taught himself to code and became a software engineer. Living with farmers and learning to bake sourdough bread at bakery apprenticeships steered Andrew back in the direction of food production and when he moved back to the North Shore of MA in 2021, he found work at Black Earth Compost where he now works full-time as a Facilities Construction Specialist at the North Shore Regional Compost Facility.
