        An agricultural technical assistance provider, <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> lowers the barrier to entry for established small farms interested in adding cereal grains into existing crop rotations by providing a reliable harvesting service and offering post-harvest technical assistance in coastal Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire. This service alleviates a bottleneck, the limited availability of small combines, for farmers getting started with small grains like wheat, rye, barley, and oats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Winter grains are an excellent tool in the toolkit for the ecological farmer. These cover crops can be planted after late-season harvests in September or October, photosynthesizing and tillering through the shoulder seasons, retaining moisture and preventing erosion through the winter. In the spring, a nitrogen fixing legume like clover can be frost-seeded below them. These tall grasses act as a nursery for clover until July or August when they’re harvested for grain and straw and the clover is ready to take off. Farmers benefit from their food and fiber, and the farmlands benefit from the extended fallow period and added organic matter and nitrogen for next seasons’ vegetables. As storage crops, grains also offset labor on farms to a time of year when fieldwork is less demanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> works with farmers on an individual basis to plan harvests, end-use markets, install grain drying bins on-farm, and facilitate seed cleaning. Value-add processing like stone milling, rolling, and pearling are excellent options for partnering farms, but thanks to the interconnectedness of the grain chain of the Northeast, processing can likely be shared as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> believes that a robust patchwork of small farms can regenerate carbon capturing soils, closing gaps in nutrient cycles; and imagines a future where small to medium scale farms here in the Northeast replace a larger portion of commodities on grocery shelves.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Our farming practices:</h4>
        <p>
          As combine operators and short-haul truckers, our aim is to have long-term partnerships with farms, giving farmers a chance to work with small grains here in the Northeast, sowing the seeds of our future which quite often already exist in the seeds of our past. We prioritize feedback loops because the combine operator doesn’t get to see the field as often as the farmer, and the farmer doesn’t get to see the underside of the combine as often as the mechanic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The farming practices we support are regenerative; the farms we’re partnering with are already organic-practicing or certified organic—they’re not using herbicides and pesticides, they’re composting, they’re cover cropping, they’re mulching—but to regenerate is to heal, and to heal is to recognize that there has been some harmful land-use in the past. With that starting place in mind, we evaluate our farm partnerships based on mutual understandings of where they’d like to see their agroecology in a ten years and how incorporating grain growing can help them get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          As machine operators, we aim to minimize the amount of fossil fuels that we burn and to be transparent in the amount of burn that we make each year. The best way to understand our carbon footprint is to measure it. We count miles and gallons during harvest season every year.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Our value-added food producer practices:</h4>
        <p>
          As value-added food producers, we aim to make the tastiest and most nutrient-dense whole grain flours, rolled oats, and pearled barleys. Someday, we’d like to offer gluten-free flours from pseudograins like buckwheat. We prioritize the farming, and will continue to develop our line of products as it fits our partnering farms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Namesake and an ode to small farms:</h4>
        <p>
          With each harvest, small farms are filling bellies with nutrient-dense whole foods, contributing to building resilient communities, and reconnecting people with the land. It’s a stark contrast to the factory farms with their singular goal of productivity, a mission that has caused massive soil degradation and fertilizer dependency world-wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The toll that the factory framework has taken is felt by the local farmer and by the land. As we look for ways to make our farming practices more sustainable, we are called to remember that this land that we grow on is not ours. We share these fields with the life beneath our feet and growing above our heads, and even on our busiest days we must make time to fill our role in this reciprocal relationship, giving back here and there.
        </p>

        <h4>The combine operator:</h4>
        <p>Hi, I’m Andrew Dixon!</p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Groveland, Massachusetts carrying Eggo waffles to the bus stop. I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at UMass Amherst and worked from 2016 to 2020 as a self-taught software engineer where I found inspiration in the peer-to-peer networks of the open source community. A pandemic-era mutual aid network food security effort and an apprenticeship at Trent’s Bread in Westford, VT got me interest in the world of microbes and bread as a community builder; especially rye bread. Following curiosity, I made a career change in 2021 and worked in Cape Ann, Massachusetts at Alprilla Farm part-time and Black Earth Compost full-time. At the compost site, I learned more about global nutrient cycles and food-scrap composting facility construction, finally putting that mechanical engineering degree to some use. On the farm, I learned about soil biology, crop rotations, and the role of winter grains. When I’m not on a farm or in the shop, I’m probably in the woods. Occasionally, I sing baritone folk songs at karaoke night.

        <h4>Land Acknowledgement</h4>
        <p>
          In the lower Merrimack Valley, <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> has been farming on the unceded ancestral lands of the indigenous Pawtucket people. We recognize that the land that we grow on is not ours; we share these fields with the beings below our feet and above our heads.

      <h2>Historical Precendent</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>Why support small scale grain growers?</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> wants bakers and eaters to understand just how fledgling the revival of the small scale grain grower in the United States is. The reemergence here in the Northeast despite the consolidation of farmlands by large corporations nationwide is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of the American farmer, mindful of the ecological  trade-offs necessary to reach for financial footing in many conventional markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          All compelling arguments for supporting the local food movement extend to the revival of grain growing, but the barriers to entry for the small scale grain farmer are so high in this generation due to the past fifty years of investment targeted almost exclusively at the industrial scale, that farmers who are just getting set up to grow human consumable grains sure could use your support. The primary bottleneck, the limited availability of properly sized combines, is the first and largest hurdle. In the past twenty years, some of the other pieces—seed cleaning facilities, stone mills, and markets for whole grains—have seen steady redevelopment, especially in Vermont and Maine. This infrastructure has been a little slower to develop in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, but there are several farmers working hard to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean, high quality wheat and rye with good falling numbers and adequate protein is a prerequisite, but the price premiums for these local products should be understood from the standpoint of our historical neglect for this scale of grain growing. How often do you see a bag of flour or a loaf of bread labeled with a farm name that you know?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What is a custom combiner?</h4>
        <p>
          Americans on both of the coasts are largely unaware of the “custom combiner.” A quick wiki search and you’ll learn that this industry does a large portion of the commodity grain harvesting; not all bean, grain, and forage farms own and maintain their own harvesters for financial and practical reasons. Each year beginning in May, custom combiners put their equipment on trucks and haul them northwards from Texas to Saskatchewan, traveling farm to farm, harvesting crops and leaving them at nearby silos. Historically, custom combiners developed long-term partnerships with farms that they’d visit year after year. Today, with the increased consolidation of farmlands, I’m not sure how that looks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Adapting the role of custom combiner:</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> is adapting this model to fit the small farms in coastal Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire. Without chemicals, we can harvest tons of food right away. Glyphosate and other herbicides are used in conventional wheat production to dessicate weeds and sometimes to dry down green straw prior to inflexible, pre-scheduled harvest dates with custom combiners so that their harvesters don’t bind up in the field. This is the lazy, cost-cutting approach. A skilled combine operator can harvest a field with some weeds and green straw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here in the Northeast is, grain growers harvest when the sun shines. This isn’t the semi-arid climate of the Great Plains, but we still have plenty of sunny days in July. Still, this can create scheduling conflicts because every farmer wants their grain harvested on the sunny day when their grains are dry. We reduce some of this risk by segmenting the harvesting months. For example, we plan a harvesting route with farm locations, one with an early maturing barley, another with a July wheat, and our final stop at the north-most farm to harvest later-maturing rye. This allows us to build in some flexibility to our harvest schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reward for quality grains here in the Northeast can outweigh the challenges for farmers and custom combiners relative to the reward of the conventional grower. Livestock feed and commodity grain markets have lower payouts than the human consumable grains. Around here, we don’t lack demand for quality grains.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>Why winter grains?</h4>
        <p>
          Winter rye and winter wheat can grow for 295 days, making them one of the longest annual crops. During this time they cover our soil, photosynthesizing in the shoulder seasons, their roots becoming the chip leaders at the microbial poker table in the rhizosphere. For the vegetable farmer, after periods of cultivation and productivity, it becomes important to rest their fields. Winter grains enable farmers to fallow their fields without entirely foregoing a marketable food offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the late summer or fall, after a vegetable crop is harvested we plant wheat or rye. In the early spring, these hearty grasses with their firm hold on life can be grazed to promote tillering, giving our ruminant friends an opportunity to deposit some organic fertility on our fields. We often seed a nitrogen-fixing legume like clover near the final frost date, our winter grains act as a nursery for the clover and when the grain is harvested off as a mid-summer cash crop, the clover is ready to take off and nourish, aerate and protect the soil through another winter, readying the field to return to vegetable production the following summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil organic matter levels on this continent once averaged between 5 and 10 percent; now the national average for soil organic matter in the United States has declined to 1 percent level because we have cropped our farmland way too hard with too much added synthetic nitrogen [1, Jack Lazor]. Grasses grown to maturity, once they’ve turned from green to brown and their stalks have become woody, incorporated into soils can boost organic matter by a percentage or more. A common practice on small organic farms today is tarping their fields to smother or solarize crop residues. Winter cover cropping with seed heads harvested off can accomplish a similar goal with less labor on a larger field size.

      <h2>More About</h2>
      <div>
        <h4>What did the first three seasons look like for <i>Here and There Grain Project</i>?</h4>
        <p>
          Since 2021, <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> has been farming organic winter grains on the North Shore of Massachusetts. While thinning carrots at Alprilla Farm in Essex, Massachusetts with farmers Sophie and Noah Courser-Kellerman, we talked a lot about bread making, grain growing and the challenges unique to our region; these conversations often punctuated with, "what a good question!" or, "how does that work?" provoked an interest in crop planning and soil management strategies for me that evolved into a partnership and eventually into <i>Here and There Grain Project</i>. In 2022, Noah and Sophie began moving to their farm to Warner, New Hampshire and I took on some of the fieldwork for their final grain growing season, assisting in harvest, drying, cleaning, milling and the rest. I had to market the flour collaboration somehow, the <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was less interested in leasing my own land, and more interested in partnering with existing farms. Free Nitrogen from fields of fertilized vegetables and friends to collaborate with on farm hacks—no brainer! I was introduced to Alex Cecchinelli and Stacey Apple of Iron Ox Farm in South Hamilton in the summer of 2022 and our shared interest in growing a booming crop of wheat led to a shared purchase of an 1959 Allis Chalmers All Crop 66A combine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023 we fixed up that combine, plowed some new fields, and raised a half acre of ‘Sangaste’ rye and the next year an acre of ‘Redeemer’ wheat. After easily 150 hours of repairs, to watch that combine chug through an acre of wheat was jaw dropping. Thanks to the help of many friends, this project had found its feet under it on the sheep shed dance floor in the Ipswich river bend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heading into 2025, Iron Ox Farm and <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> looked to build on their successes, and since an All Crop isn’t fun to put on a trailer and Iron Ox had already planted their next acre of wheat, set out to purchase a self-propelled combine and a trailer to pursue the mobile harvesting business that I dreamed of but didn’t know much about back in 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back on those first three seasons, <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> served a transitional role in a community with one grain grower on their way out, their reliable customer-base eager for more local grains, and another farm all set to take up the torch. The generous know-how sharing that happens on farms continues to encourage me to find work in agriculture and local food systems.

        <h4>Core Values:</h4>
        <p>
          <i>
            Directions: think big picture, generalize, tell people your value system, express ideology so that farmers and bakers who share these values have a little something to chew on. The important work is done on-farm or in the shop… don’t let the big words scare you, this is not set in stone.

              <h4>Adapting to changing climates</h4>
              <p>
                <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> recognizes that as a result of wars and the excessive extraction of natural resources, ecosystems have been degraded, biodiversity has been lost, and the perils of biosphere collapse are approaching. No individual or business is solely responsible for these damages, but it is time that we speak up for our lands. Humans only save what they love. It is time that we demonstrate care by shifting our food production towards gentler methods, reconnecting with our agroecology.

              <h4>People</h4>
              <p>
                Regenerative agriculture is first and foremost about people. People are inseparable from the land, yet so often in commodity-based food production the people involved are hidden because their labor has been exploited or because their lands have been taken away. This carelessness for human life leads to carelessness for farmlands.

            <div>
              <h4>Healing</h4>
              <p>
                To be practicing regenerative agriculture is to be “healing” soils. <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> likes this definition because it recognizes that there has been damage done. It’s important to understand and learn what each farm soil wants. Nutrients and numbers and all of that other heady stuff are important, but nourishment is the real mover and shaker. This healing work feeds people and farmlands, but is very often missed by financial and regulatory agencies.

              <p>
                <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> is committed to cultivating safety and space on farms and in shops and garages for non-white, transgender, queer, and non-binary farmers and mechanics. It is important to imagine the future we want to see from the seat of a tractor.

              <h4>Technology</h4>
              <p>
                Innovations are best evaluated before they are adopted and those advancements which give people greater connection to the land—especially those which do so for lower income communities—ought to be given preference. Fossil fuel burning technology got us into this mess, and we must look to reduce our burn in every step forward. The best way to do this is to measure our inputs.

              <h4>Food and art as activism</h4>
              <p>
                Artists who develop a dialogue with nature can be catalysts for change and are excellent collaborators in agricultural and culinary spaces. Given increasing global disconnect with what is on our plates, participating in food production and preparation is not only subversive, it can be a form of activism. Environmental justice and social justice are inextricably linked. Small scale food producers are often doing the important work of educating eaters, but this responsibility can be readily shared unlike fieldwork and kitchenwork.

        <h4>Beyond the Horizon:</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> is a slow growing operation dedicated to long-term partnerships. The horizon for this stage of growth is a reliable harvesting service for three farms in 2026. Once this horizon is more clearly in reach, <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> will increase its effort to advocate for policy changes to support small farms.
        </p>
        <p>
          One example of a piece of legislation which could be improved is the chapter 61A property tax advantage for landowners who have five or more acres of land “actively devoted” to agricultural or horticultural purposes (Massachusetts). This black and white tax advantage could be improved if it were more granular, incentivizing landowners to put their properties into agricultural uses beyond hay production. Haying has blanketed much of the agriculturally viable lands despite the limited availability of farmlands for young farmers with more diverse farming practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another arena which <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> would like to see progress is transparency of fossil fuel inputs to businesses. Reducing our carbon footprint is important, and it begins with measuring the amount of gas and diesel that we use. <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> will look to keep records of these inputs and would like to work towards reducing these year after year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Here and There Grain Project</i> will continue to operate grain harvesting equipment and maybe someday we’ll know a thing or two about how combines work, perhaps enough to demonstrate to distributors and manufacturers that there again exists a need for resumed production of small combines. Or maybe we’ll set our sites on imported equipment and distribution. Check back in a few years.
